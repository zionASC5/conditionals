///////////////
// BACKSTORY //
///////////////
// You're an android in an unforgiving world where humans rule.
// Your decisions now will affect the world later.
// What choices will you make?
// This is totally NOT a rip off from a popular 2018 game.

///////////////////////////////
// BASIC "IF/ELSE" STATEMENT //
///////////////////////////////
// Create a variable "username" and set it equal to the user's
// third command line argument when calling 'node conditional.js'
const zion = process.argv[2]
console.log (zion) 

console.log (`Hello, ${zion}`)
// If "username" is defined, console.log(`Hello, ${username}`)
// Otherwise, console.log("You must provide a username");

// HINT: you can check if a variable is defined by using it
// as a condition. Ex. if(someVariable){...}

// Test to make sure the script is working as intended. Save this file
// and in the command line execute 'node conditional.js'
// Then try 'node conditional.js zion'

/////////////////////////////////
// "IF/ELSE IF/ELSE" STATEMENT //

// else if "item" is "paint", subtract 30 from "money" and console.log("You bought paint");

// BOOLEAN OPERATORS //
///////////////////////
console.log("You exit the store and find yourself in the middle of an anti-android protest!");
console.log("You could run or stay...");

//This is called A ternary operator! It's a shorthand if/else statement.
const randomPerson = Math.random() > .5 ? "John" : "Felipe"; 
// The syntax of it is:
// condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
// All that's being done is we're just setting the variable randomPerson equal to the outcome of that ternary statement, in this case what is the condition being tested?

// You're given a variable "randomPerson" that is a string
// NOTE: 
// We'll discuss Math.random() later this week!
// If you're interested to know more about ternary operators, google "JS ternary operator"! (Not now though, it's project time! :D)

// Create a variable "choice" and set it equal to the user's third
// command line argument

// If "choice" is NOT defined (recall how we did this with the "username" variable)
//      - console.log("You shut down due to inactivity and get robbed of all your money");
//      - reduce "money" to 0

// Else if "choice" is NOT "run" AND "randomPerson" is "Felipe" 
//      console.log("The protesters attack you...");
//      - if "item" is NOT "jacket"
//          - console.log("...but Felipe, a fellow android shows up to help you escape them");
//      - else
//          - console.log("...and Felipe, a fellow android, who would normally help doesn't recognize you with the jacket");
//          - reduce "health" by 50

// Else if "choice" is "run" AND "randomPerson" is "John" 
//      - console.log("You run, but John, a human officer with an attitude and a heart of gold, finds you...");
//      - if "item" is "hammer" OR "jacket"

//          - reduce "money" to 0
//      - else
//          - console.log("...and seeing you have no ill intent, John protects you from the protestors and lets you go.");

// Else (technically this means you ran AND got Felipe OR didn't run AND got John)
//      - if "item" is "paint"
//          - console.log("You boldy protest by painting a pro-android message...");
//          - create a variable "message" and set it equal to the user's fourth command line argument
//          - if "message" is defined
//              - console.log(`..."${message.toUpperCase()}""`);

//      - else
//          - console.log(`Nothing interesting happens, but at least you got that ${item}`);

///////////
// SCOPE //
///////////

// We'll see scope play a larger role when we talk about functions,
// but any time there are curly brackets, the space in between the 
// brackets have their own scope, meaning variables defined inside of
// that scope are inaccessible to the world outside of those brackets

// Create a variable "score" and set it equal to 0

// Add "money" and "health" to "score"

// If "choice" is defined, add 10 points to "score"
// NOTE: Recall where "choice" was initialized (created). What scope was it in?
// The global scope! So all of your code has access to it.

// if "message" is defined, add 10 points to "score"
// NOTE: Recall where "message" was initialized/created. 
// It's within curly brackets! 
// Alter your code so that "message" is initialized  in the global space 
// right alongside "choice"

//////////////////////
// STORY CONCLUSION //

// console.log("The end");
// console.log(`Score: ${score}`);
